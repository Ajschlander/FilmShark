## Platforms
FilmShark is hosted on firebase. It uses firebases hosting, cloud-functions, and firestore.

## Frameworks
FilmShark is built mainly with React. It utilizes material-ui to help with layout of the app.

## For Future Development
FilmShark is a work in-progress still. I would love to implement a comment system and a way to interact with other users on the website. Such as a online chat room or a dashboard where users can post status updates on movies they have watched or are going to watch. I would also like to implement a feature where users can drag and drop movie cards on their own page.
